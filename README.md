# Stack Too Deep Error in Solidity

This repository demonstrates a common Solidity error: the Stack Too Deep error.  The error occurs when a function exceeds the maximum allowed stack depth during execution.  Solidity has a limit on the size of the stack to prevent denial-of-service attacks and improve gas efficiency.

**Bug:** The provided `transfer` function and the `balanceOf` function are simple functions, but the `balanceOf` function accesses storage variables and might lead to a Stack Too Deep error if deeply nested or involves many parameters in a complex scenario. 

**Solution:** The solution involves refactoring the code to reduce the stack depth by using memory variables, optimizing the function calls and breaking down large complex function into smaller parts.
